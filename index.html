      <h1>Homonculus</h1>
      <p><strong>here is a brief discription of the homonculus</strong></p>
      <p>
        Homunculus are artificial humans created by Father, each embodying one
        of the seven deadly sins. They are characterized by their
        near-immortality, fueled by Philosopher's Stones, and regenerative
        abilities. They possess enhanced strength, speed, and agility, and can
        heal from almost any injury as long as their Philosopher's Stone has
        power. However, they are not truly immortal; their Philosopher's Stones
        can be depleted, leading to their death.

                  eternal life, and his rebellious nature. He is called the
                  "Ultimate Shield" because he can rearrange the carbon in his
                  body to make his skin as hard as diamond, thus making him
                  impenetrable by most weapons.

                  strength, speed and agility, he never uses them, and he is
                  always compalining about being tired. He is very tall and

                  incredible agility. He has an eye patch that hides his special

                  creature, but with the powers of the Philosopher Stone, he
                  turns into a giant reptile, but he can take the form of every
                  one that he already saw, his usual form is a pale-skinned,
                  black spiky haired guy, but even when he changes form he keeps
                  his weight of a giant reptile, and we can notice that when
                  walk, but his weight dont affect his agility and speed.
